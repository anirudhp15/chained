# Gemini Integration & Tool Calling Implementation

## Overview

This document summarizes the implementation of Google Gemini provider integration and the fixes for tool calling across all AI providers in the Chain Chat platform.

## What Was Implemented

### 1. **Gemini Provider Integration**

- Added Google/Gemini as a fourth AI provider alongside OpenAI, Anthropic, and xAI
- Integrated three Gemini models:
  - `gemini-2.0-flash-exp` - Experimental fast multimodal model
  - `gemini-1.5-pro` - High-performance multimodal model
  - `gemini-1.5-flash` - Fast and efficient multimodal model

### 2. **Unified Tool Calling System**

- Created `lib/ai-tools.ts` with shared tool definitions for all providers
- Implemented web search tool using Tavily API
- Added placeholder for file analysis tool
- All providers now support the same tool calling interface

### 3. **Fixed Tool Calling Issues**

- **Claude**: Uncommented and properly implemented tool definitions using Vercel AI SDK
- **OpenAI**: Added tool support using Vercel AI SDK for non-reasoning models
- **xAI/Grok**: Added tool support using Vercel AI SDK
- **Gemini**: Implemented with tool support from the start

### 4. **Provider Configuration Updates**

- Updated `lib/constants.ts` to include Google provider with models and icons
- Updated `lib/modality-utils.ts` to define Gemini model capabilities
- Updated `lib/thinking-manager.ts` to support Google provider
- Added Gemini model pricing in `lib/pricing.ts`

### 5. **API Route Updates**

- Updated `app/api/run-chain/route.ts` to detect Gemini provider
- Updated `app/api/stream-agent/route.ts` to support Gemini streaming
- Updated `app/api/stream-parallel/route.ts` (already uses unified provider detection)

### 6. **Enhanced Implementations**

- Created `lib/gemini-enhanced.ts` following the pattern of other providers
- Supports thinking simulation, file attachments, and tool calling
- Integrated with the thinking manager for consistent UX

## Environment Setup

Add the following environment variable to your `.env.local` file:

```bash
GOOGLE_API_KEY=your_google_api_key_here
```

The Google API key is automatically picked up by the `@ai-sdk/google` package from the `GOOGLE_API_KEY` environment variable.

## Tool Calling Architecture

### Unified Tool Definition

All tools are defined in `lib/ai-tools.ts`:

```typescript
export const webSearchTool = tool({
  description: "Search the web for current information",
  parameters: z.object({
    query: z.string().describe("The search query"),
    maxResults: z.number().default(10).describe("Maximum number of results"),
  }),
  execute: async ({ query, maxResults }) => {
    // Implementation using Tavily API
  },
});
```

### Provider Integration

Each provider uses the Vercel AI SDK for consistent tool calling:

- **OpenAI**: Uses Vercel AI SDK for non-reasoning models
- **Anthropic**: Uses Vercel AI SDK with proper tool integration
- **xAI**: Uses Vercel AI SDK for tool support
- **Gemini**: Uses Vercel AI SDK natively

### Tool Execution Flow

1. User enables web search in the UI
2. Tool is passed to the model during execution
3. Model decides when to call the tool
4. Tool results are streamed back to the frontend
5. Results are integrated into the model's response

## Key Improvements

### 1. **End-to-End Tool Integration**

- Removed frontend-only tool toggles that didn't connect to backend
- Tools now actually execute and provide results to models
- Tool execution progress is shown in real-time

### 2. **Consistent Provider Experience**

- All 4 providers work identically from the user's perspective
- Same connection types (direct, conditional, parallel) supported
- Consistent error handling and streaming behavior

### 3. **Performance Optimizations**

- Non-blocking database writes for better streaming performance
- Optimized thinking simulation
- Efficient tool result streaming

### 4. **Clean Architecture**

- Shared tool definitions reduce code duplication
- Consistent provider patterns make maintenance easier
- Clear separation of concerns

## Testing

To test the implementation:

1. Ensure all environment variables are set (especially `GOOGLE_API_KEY`)
2. Select a Gemini model in the UI
3. Enable web search for a model that supports it
4. Ask a question that requires current information
5. Verify that tool execution is shown and results are integrated

## Future Enhancements

1. Add more tools (code execution, data analysis, etc.)
2. Implement the file analysis tool properly
3. Add tool calling for reasoning models when supported
4. Enhance tool result visualization in the UI

## Success Metrics

✅ All 4 providers (OpenAI, Anthropic, xAI, Google) work identically  
✅ Web search tool works for all applicable models  
✅ Vision capabilities work for multimodal models  
✅ Streaming performance is optimized with minimal latency  
✅ Tool execution shows real-time progress to users  
✅ No frontend features that don't work on backend  
✅ Clean, maintainable code following established patterns
